## Tutorials
These tutorials are an outline of how to interact with the EDITO STAC, and utilize the Analysis-ready and cloud-optimized (ARCO) data products. The tutorials presents some of the more fundamental concepts and methods for being able to find the ARCO datasets in a STAC catalog, take a subset of data of interest, and perform some basic visual analysis. 

## Deployment
The notebook is deployed on [Edito Datalab](https://datalab.dive.edito.eu/) as a tutorial.
